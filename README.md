# MapReadingPractice 2.0 Now in Beta
I've been slowly working on rewriting the website from scratch to remove some of the clunk and add a lot of requested features.
Beta site is accessible [here!](https://husky-rotmg.github.io/MapReadingPractice-Web/beta)

New features once beta is completed include:
- Map history (up to last 400 maps)
- Favorited maps for easy access
- Map editor for editing and building custom maps
- A DPad that doesn't break for 1/4 of the users on mobile

- Make sure shifts are always applied correctly
- Stats integrations
- Add DPad
- Add change highlight color buttons

### Map Editor
- Make defender not placeable if bleeds out of map
- Verify map button to confirm if it's a valid map
- Add set troom button

### Settings

## Link to Website

## How to Use
By default, you can use WASD and/or arrow keys to move around. 

If you wish to use mobile, you can enable the d-pad feature by clicking on the settings (gears) button, and enabling the feature. The d-pad can be moved around by dragging the center, and will make sure to always be visible when re-orienting the page.

Take a look around settings to see what else you can do! A help menu will be added (eventually), to describe each option in more detail.
